# CHALLENGE PROMPTS

## ACCEPT A CHALLENGE
⋗ **When you accept a challenge** (a foe to defeat, an obstacle to overcome, a mystery to solve, a mission to complete, a promise to fulfill, etc), define its rank and write it down, setting its value to 1%. Then, if you are...
- ...caught in a trap, sizing up the situation or using careful tactics to outsmart the opposition:<br/>
 test your <span class="stat">BRAIN</span>.
- ...in the thick of it, at close quarters or with violence:<br/>
 test your <span class="stat">CHROME</span>.
- ...on the move or using your speed and the environment to your advantage:<br/>
 test your <span class="stat">EDGE</span>.
- ...facing off defiantly against the opposition, or depending on your courage and leadership:<br/>
 test your <span class="stat">FLASH</span>.
- ...hidden, using trickery or acting against an unaware foe:<br/>
 test your <span class="stat">SHADE</span>.

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You are ready to begin the challenge. You are _IN CONTROL_. 

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also gain a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> to your next test.

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: There's trouble up ahead. You are _IN A BAD SPOT_. 

> If <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL</span>, also gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to your next test.
<br/>

<br/>

## MAKE PROGRESS
⋗ **When you make significant progress in your challenge by doing any of the following...**
- overcoming a critical obstacle
- gaining meaningful insight
- acquiring a crucial item or resource
- gaining vital support
- defeating a powerful foe
- as a result from a PROMPT

...you may increment the challenge value as per its rank:

**SHORT**: +30%.<br/>
**MEDIUM**: +20%.<br/>
**LONG**: +10%.<br/>
**EXTREME**: +5%.<br/>
**EPIC**: +2%.<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

## FULFILL A CHALLENGE
⋗ **When you consider it’s time to fulfill a Challenge,** test against that Challenge’s value (If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_, you get a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to this roll).

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: The challenge is completed. Gain XP as per its rank:

**SHORT**: 2XP.<br/>
**MEDIUM**: 5XP.<br/>
**LONG**: 10XP.<br/>
**EXTREME**: 20XP.<br/>
**EPIC**: 50XP.<br/>

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> for a following test.

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: The challenge is not done yet; there is more to be done or you realize an unwelcome truth that separates you from the objective. Choose one: 
- **Recommit**: Raise the challenge's rank by one (if not already EPIC) and halve its Progress value (rounded down).
- **Give Up**: [FAIL A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#fail-a-challenge).

> If <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL</span>, everyone involved must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

<hr/>
<br/>

## FAIL A CHALLENGE
⋗ **When you renounce your mission, succumb in battle, betray your promise, or a goal is lost to you,** clear the challenge. Then envision the impact of this failure and [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) as appropriate to its nature. Any allies who shared this challenge may also envision a cost.
