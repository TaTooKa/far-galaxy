## ACT UNDER PRESSURE
⋗ **When you attempt something risky, race against the clock or react to an imminent threat...**
- ...with expertise, insight or observation:<br/>
test your <Stat name="SMARTS"/>.
- ...with aggressiveness, strength or endurance:<br/>
test your <Stat name="MIGHT"/>.
- ...with speed, agility or precision:<br/>
test your <Stat name="SWIFT"/>.
- ...with appeal, flamboyance or credibility:<br/>
test your <Stat name="ZEAL"/>.
- ...with deception, stealth or trickery:<br/>
test your <Stat name="GUILE"/>.
<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You achieve what you set out to do. If you are _IN CONTROL_, [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress). If you were _IN A BAD SPOT_, you are now _IN CONTROL_.

> If <span class="blueish bold">CRITICAL</span>, also gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> to a future related action.

&nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: you fail, the opposition prevails, or your progress is undermined by a dramatic and costly turn of events. If you were _IN CONTROL_, you are now _IN A BAD SPOT_.  
> If <span class="reddish bold">CRITICAL</span> or you were _IN A BAD SPOT_, you must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

- ...with expertise, insight or observation:<br/>
test your <Stat name="SMARTS"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You set up an advantage or gain leverage. Choose two (only one if you are _IN A BAD SPOT_):

- [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress)
- [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress) again
- You are _IN CONTROL_

&nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: the opposition gains the upper hand, the action moves to a worse location, you encounter a new peril, or your assumptions betray you. If you were _IN CONTROL_, you are now _IN A BAD SPOT_.

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

## GATHER INFORMATION
⋗ **When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research,** test your <Stat name="SMARTS"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: you discover something helpful and specifific.  The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn ([QUERY THE FATES](/prompts/fate-prompts#query-the-fates) if unsure). Then gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> when acting upon it.

> If <span class="blueish bold">CRITICAL</span> and you are _IN CONTROL_, also [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress).

&nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your job. You are _IN A BAD SPOT_ and must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).
<hr/>
<br/>

test your <Stat name="ZEAL"/>.
- ...by threatening or inciting them:<br/>
test your <Stat name="MIGHT"/>.
- ...by lying or swindling:<br/>
test your <Stat name="GUILE"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: If you are _IN CONTROL_ they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions; If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_ they'll ask for something in exchange.
> If <span class="blueish bold">CRITICAL</span>, also [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress).

 &nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: If you are _IN CONTROL_, their agreement comes with a severe condition or complication. If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_, they outright refuse.
> If <span class="reddish bold">CRITICAL</span>, also [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

<hr/>
<br/>

## USE YOUR GEAR
⋗ **When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, as long as your GEAR is 1 or greater, you have it and are ready to use it (it gives _narrative permission_, improves _fictional positioning_ or gives a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> when used). 

Then [SACRIFICE RESOURCES (-1)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#sacrifice-resources) if the item is of a _one-time use_, or [SACRIFICE RESOURCES (-2)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#sacrifice-resources) if it's _unlimited_ or should last for at least a couple of scenes.

<hr/>
<br/>

## CLASH
⋗ **When you clash with one or more foes at close quarters,** test your <Stat name="MIGHT"/>. **If you attack at a distance**, test your <Stat name="SWIFT"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You dominate your foe. If you are _IN CONTROL_, [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress). If you were _IN A BAD SPOT_, you are now _IN CONTROL_.

> If <span class="blueish bold">CRITICAL</span>, also [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress) again.

&nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: The fight turns against you or the opposition dominates the exchange. If you were _IN CONTROL_, you are now _IN A BAD SPOT_.

> If <span class="reddish bold">CRITICAL</span> or you were _IN A BAD SPOT_, you must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

<hr/>
<br/>

## USE THE FORCE
⋗ **When you tap into *The Force* to do something out of the ordinary...**
- ...with insight or observation:<br/>
test your <Stat name="SMARTS"/>.
- ...with aggressiveness, strength or endurance:<br/>
test your <Stat name="MIGHT"/>.
- ...with speed, agility or precision:<br/>
test your <Stat name="SWIFT"/>.
- ...with appeal, flamboyance or credibility:<br/>
test your <Stat name="ZEAL"/>.
- ...with deception, stealth or trickery:<br/>
test your <Stat name="GUILE"/>.
<br/> 

> (If you are not a [FORCE ADEPT](/character-traits#skillForceadept) or [FORCE MASTER](/character-traits#skillForcemaster), you gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to this roll).

&nbsp;<span class="blueish bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You cause a subtle effect or minor alteration *(producing a far-away noise, moving a small object, empowering yourself, gaining focus)*, but it strains you: [ENDURE STRESS (-1)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress).
* If you are a [FORCE ADEPT](/character-traits#skillForceadept), you can instead choose to cause a more overt effect or moderate alteration *(pushing someone, pulling something from someone’s grasp, trying to mind-trick a lesser mind)*, then [ENDURE STRESS (-2)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress).
* If you are a [FORCE MASTER](/character-traits#skillForcemaster), you can instead choose to execute a very apparent display of force-use *(jumping or accelerating way beyond normal capabilities, lifting a huge object, producing force-lightning)*, then [ENDURE STRESS (-3)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress).
<br/>
<br/>
Any of these options lets you gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> to an immediate related action.

> If <span class="blueish bold">CRITICAL</span>, reduce the **WILL** penalty by 1 when you [ENDURE STRESS](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress).

&nbsp;<span class="reddish bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: You can’t channel the **Light Side** of *The Force*. You can forgo your intentions, or push on by tapping into the **Dark Side** of *The Force*, in which case you can choose any of the options from the <span class="blueish bold">SUCCESS</span> list but increasing the WILL penalty by 1 when ENDURING STRESS.

> If <span class="reddish bold">CRITICAL</span> and you choose to tap into the Dark Side, increase the **WILL** penalty by 1 more when you [ENDURE STRESS](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress).
