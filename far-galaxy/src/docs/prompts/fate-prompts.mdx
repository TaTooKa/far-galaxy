# FATE PROMPTS

## PAY THE CONSEQUENCES
⋗ **When you suffer the outcome of a mechanical or narrative <span class="reddish">FAILURE</span>**, choose one (If you suffer a <span class="reddish bold">CRITICAL FAILURE</span>, make it worse or choose two):

- Make the most obvious negative narrative outcome happen. If the current context doesn't give you any clues, remember that your **OBLIGATION** is always a good source of trouble.
- Reveal a **Peril** related to the current context, either provided by the Oracles you are currently using, or getting a random [STORY COMPLICATION](/oracles/core-oracles#story-complication).
- Trigger a prompt that makes sense for your actions: [ENDURE HARM](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-harm), [ENDURE STRESS](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress) or [SACRIFICE RESOURCES](/prompts/suffer-prompts#sacrifice-resources).
- [QUERY THE FATES](/prompts/fate-prompts#query-the-fates) for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship or complication appropriate to the situation.
- Choose (or roll) one of the following outcomes as inspiration:

| RANDOM OUTCOMES | |
| --- | --- |
| **01-05**: A trusted individual or community acts against you | **46-50**: An individual or community you care about is exposed to danger |

| **26-30**: The environment or terrain introduces a new hazard | **71-75**: A new enemy or peril is revealed |
| **31-35**: Your equipment or vehicle malfunctions | **76-80**: You draw some heat for your actions |

| **41-45**: You are delayed or put at a disadvantage | **91-00**: You are harmed or stressed |
